## Usage

The **Merge Diffusion Tool** provides three main operations:

1. **Merge Two LoRA Models**
2. **Merge LoRA into a Checkpoint**
3. **Merge Two Checkpoints**

### Command-Line Arguments:

| Argument         | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--operation`    | Select operation: `merge_loras`, `merge_lora_checkpoint`, `merge_checkpoints`|
| `--model1`       | Path to the first model file.                                                |
| `--model2`       | Path to the second model file (optional for LoRA into checkpoint).           |
| `--output`       | Output path for the merged model.                                            |
| `--alpha`        | Blend ratio for merging models (default: 0.5).                               |
| `--merge_weight` | Weight for merging LoRA into checkpoint (default: 0.5).                      |

### Example 1: Merging Two LoRA Models

```bash
python main.py --operation merge_loras --model1 lora1.safetensors --model2 lora2.safetensors --output output_lora.safetensors --alpha 0.7
```

This command merges `lora1.safetensors` and `lora2.safetensors`, with 70% contribution from `lora1`.

### Example 2: Merging LoRA into a Checkpoint

```bash
python main.py --operation merge_lora_checkpoint --model1 lora_model.safetensors --model2 checkpoint_model.safetensors --output output_checkpoint.safetensors --merge_weight 0.6
```

In this example, the LoRA model merges into the checkpoint with 60% influence.

### Example 3: Merging Two Checkpoints

```bash
python main.py --operation merge_checkpoints --model1 checkpoint1.safetensors --model2 checkpoint2.safetensors --output output_checkpoint.safetensors --alpha 0.5
```

Merges both checkpoint models in a 50-50 blend.
